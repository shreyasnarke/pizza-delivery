# pizza-deliver-java
The Pizza Delivery JavaScript/JSP Application is a web-based platform designed to streamline the process of ordering and delivering pizzas. The application allows customers to browse through a menu, select their desired pizzas, customize toppings, and place orders. The application incorporates interactive features using JavaScript to enhance the user experience, such as real-time price calculation and dynamic updates based on user selections. The backend functionality is implemented using JSP (JavaServer Pages), enabling seamless communication with the server for processing orders, managing inventory, and generating invoices. The application includes features for tracking order status, providing delivery updates, and allowing customers to provide feedback. The project utilizes JavaScript for client-side interactivity, JSP for server-side processing, and database integration to store and retrieve pizza and customer-related data. Detailed documentation will be provided to guide users on how to effectively use the application.
